I have finally managed to find a blogging platform that I actually like. I tried to get used to Wordpress multiple times
but I could never get the hang of it. Wordpress seems bloated and I easily get lost in all those settings and don't even 
get me started on the WYSIWYG editor. As of yet I have not had the pleasure of working with a WYSIWYG editor that actually
works (I am looking at you Word) and the one in Wordpress is all kinds of horrible.

What are the alternatives? Well Joomla is even more horrible than Wordpress, Drupal seems too much like Wordpress and Tumblr
is note really for blogging about serious stuff. That is why I always wrote my own blogging platform. Yes it sucked a lot but
I had full control and I usually made it so that I like them. But a few months ago I discovered Jekyll and I was impressed imediatly.

Jekyll
------

Jekyll, for those that have not yet heard of it, is a blogging platform designed especially for programers. You write your blogs
using Markdown - the same thing that makes Github README files a pleasure to write. The best thing about it is that you can write
posts in your favorite text editor (like vim, emacs or even eclipse if your wish), and can even use git as a way of version control.
A programmers dream, am I right?

But it gets even better.

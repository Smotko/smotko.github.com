A week or so ago I was able to preorder a little peace of hardware named Raspberry Pi. On the day the thing got released I and a few other people from the internets managed to take down both Farnell and RS Components sites. I heard the first 10.000 units were sold out in 7 minutes or so. Wow!

What is it

Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably already know what a Raspberry Pi is. It's a tiny computer with an ARM processor. It has hdmi, audio, ethernet and 2 usb ports. It is somewhat comparable by performance to an iPhone, but a Raspberry Pi costs less than a HDMI connector for the iPhone. It was made to help children across the world to learn programming, but the first few batches will probably be all bought up by geeks like me.

Why do I want one
-----------------

I already own a similar device - an ARMv5 chip whith a 196MHz processor and some RAM. I use it to run an annoying IRC bot, that logs our chats and tells us when a link is a repost (some of it's code is on [Github](https://github.com/Smotko/botko), but I must warn you that it isn't very well written). This little ARM chip is great, but I have run into a few problems whit it. I haven't managed to get git working, as all of my crosscompiling attempts have failed. To be fair, I had this problem with everything that isn't in the default buildroot environment, which only contains a handful of applications I would like to use.

Raspberry Pi will, on the other hand, is backed up by actual Linux distributions (Arch, Debian and Fedora) and I am very confident, that installing software will not be such a pain. This will of course make the Pi useful for many things. Here are a few things that come to mind: 

* Host for private git projects,
* simple webserver for testing out things like nodejs,
* SSH "entrance" for my home network,
* my IRC chat bot.

The Raspbarry Pi is ideal for this as it has a processor that can tackle all of these things, and, as it doesn't have any movable parts, is completely silent. It also uses a small amount of energy which is always a good thing.

And much more
-------------

The stuff I mentioned so far is just the geeky stuff that I will be doing as soon as I get my Raspberry Pi. There are many uses for it for less techy users as well. It  can be used as a movie player (it even plays full hd videos), and it can probably transform ones USB hard drive into a network disk. As it can run a desktop environment it could even be used for some simple office work or web browsing.

How about you

What are going to do with your Raspberry 3.14?
